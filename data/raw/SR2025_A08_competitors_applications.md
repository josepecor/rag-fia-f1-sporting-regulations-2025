# Article 8 – Competitors applications

## 8.1

Applications to compete in the Championship may be submitted to the FIA during the period 21 October to 1 November inclusive of the year prior to the year to which the application relates on an entry form as set out in Appendix 2 hereto accompanied by an undertaking to pay the entry fee, calculated in accordance with Appendix 4, to the FIA no later than 10 15 December of the year prior to the year to which the application relates. Applications at other times will only be considered if a place is available and on payment of a late entry fee to be fixed by the FIA. Entry forms will be made available by the FIA who will notify the applicant of the result of the application within thirty (30) days of its receipt.

Successful applicants are automatically entered in all Competitions of the Championship and will be the only Competitors at Competitions.

## 8.2 Applications shall include:

### a)

Confirmation that the applicant has read and understood the Regulations and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of everyone associated with its participation in the Championship, to observe them.

### b)

The name of the team (which must include the name of the chassis).

### c)

The make of the competing car.

### d)

### e)

The names of the drivers. A driver may be nominated subsequent to the application upon payment of a fee fixed by the FIA.

### f)

An undertaking by the applicant to participate in every Competition with the number of cars and drivers entered.

## 8.3

A Competitor may change the make of engine at any time during the Championship. All points scored with an engine of different make to that which was first entered in the Championship may count (and will be aggregated) for the assessment of a commercial benefit, however such points will not count towards (nor be aggregated for) the FIA Formula One Constructors Championship. A major car manufacturer may not directly or indirectly supply engines for more than three (3) Competitors of two (2) cars each without the consent of the FIA. For the purposes of this Article 8.3, a major car manufacturer is a company whose shares are quoted on a recognised stock exchange or the subsidiary of such a company.

## 8.4

With the exception of those whose cars have scored points in the Championship of the previous year, applicants must supply information about the size of their company, their financial position and their ability to meet their prescribed obligations.

## 8.5

All applications will be studied by the FIA and accepted or rejected at its absolute discretion. The FIA will publish the list of cars and drivers accepted together with their race numbers on or before 19 December of the year prior to the year to which the applications relate, having first notified unsuccessful applicants as set out in Article 8.1. Out-of-time applications will be considered separately.

## 8.6

No more than twenty-six (26) cars will be admitted to the Championship, two (2) being entered by each Competitor.

## 8.7

If in the opinion of the F1 Commission, a Competitor fails to operate his team in a manner compatible with the standards of the Championship or in any way brings the Championship into disrepute, the FIA may exclude such Competitor from the Championship forthwith.
