# Article 12 – Organisation of competitions

12.1 An organiser is a body nominated by the ASN and appointed by the FIA. Upon deciding to grant an application to hold a Competition, the FIA will invite the relevant ASN to organise it or to nominate an organiser. If the ASN is not in a position to do so, the FIA may itself appoint an organiser. The organiser must be a club or body acceptable to the FIA and must enter into an organisation agreement with the FIA when it applies to organise the Competition.
