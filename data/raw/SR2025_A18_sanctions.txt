# Article 18 – Sanctions

18.1 The stewards may impose the penalties specifically set out in these Sporting Regulations in addition to or instead of any other penalties available to them under the Code.

18.2 Any driver who receives five (5) reprimands in the same Championship will, upon the imposition of the fifth, be given a ten (10) grid place penalty for the race at that Competition. If the fifth reprimand is imposed following an Incident during a race the ten (10) grid place penalty will be applied for the race at the driver’s next Competition.
The ten (10) grid place penalty will only be imposed if at least four (4) of the reprimands were imposed for a driving infringement.
