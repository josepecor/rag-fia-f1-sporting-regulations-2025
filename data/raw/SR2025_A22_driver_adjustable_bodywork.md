# Article 22 – Driver adjustable bodywork

## 22.1 Driver adjustable bodywork permitted by Article 3.10.10 of the Technical Regulations.

### a)

The driver adjustable bodywork may only be activated by the driver in any of the pre-determined activation zones around each circuit. The Race Director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems.

### b)

If the adjustable bodywork is disabled in this way at any time during any of the three periods of the qualifying session (Q1, Q2, or Q3) or the sprint qualifying session (SQ1, SQ2 or SQ3) it will remain disabled for the remainder of the relevant period.

### c)

For the sole purpose of improving overtaking opportunities during the sprint session and the race the adjustable bodywork may be activated by the driver after he has completed one (1) lap after the start or following a safety car period.

### d)

The driver may only activate the adjustable bodywork in a sprint session or the race when he has been notified via the control electronics (see Article 8.2 of the Technical Regulations) that it is enabled. It will be enabled, and may only be used by the driver, if he is less than one (1) second behind another at any of the pre-determined detection points around each track.

### e)

The system will be disabled by the control electronics the first time the driver uses the brakes after he has activated the system.

### f)

In conditions of poor visibility, or if yellow flags are being shown in the activation zone, the Race Director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve or yellow flags are withdrawn.

### g)

The FIA may, after consulting all Competitors, adjust the above time proximity in order to ensure the stated purpose of the adjustable bodywork is met.

### h)

In the event of a failure in the system which notifies the driver that he was within one (1) second of the car in front, and is hence authorised to use the adjustable bodywork, the Competitor concerned may ask the Race Director for permission to override the system. If permission is given in this way the onus will be upon the Competitor concerned to ensure that their driver only uses the adjustable bodywork if he is within one (1) second of the car in front of him.

#### i)

If the failure in the system is rectified the driver may no longer use this override, the Race Director will notify the Competitor if and when the fault has been remedied.
