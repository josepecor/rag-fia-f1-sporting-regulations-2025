# Article 26 – General safety

## 26.1

Official instructions will be given to drivers by means of the signals laid out in the Code. Competitors must not use flags or lights similar to these. In accordance with Appendix H of the Code, the light signals displayed on the trackside light panels have the same meaning as flag signals.

## 26.2

Save where these Sporting Regulations require otherwise, pit lane and track discipline and safety measures will be the same for all free practice sessions, the qualifying session, the sprint qualifying session and sprint session as for the race.

## 26.3

Other than by driving on the track, Competitors are not permitted to attempt to alter the grip of any part of the track surface.

## 26.4

If a car stops on the track, it shall be the duty of the marshals to remove it as quickly as possible so that its presence does not constitute a danger or hinder other Competitors. Under no circumstances may a driver stop his car on the track without justifiable reason.

## 26.5

A driver who abandons a car must leave it in neutral or with the clutch disengaged, with the ERS shut down and with the steering wheel in place.

## 26.6

Save as specifically authorised by the Code or these Sporting Regulations, no one except the driver may touch a stopped car unless it is in the paddock, the Competitors’ designated garage area, the pit lane or on the starting grid.

## 26.7

During the period commencing fifteen (15) minutes prior to and ending five (5) minutes after every free practice session, qualifying session and sprint qualifying session and the period between the commencement of the formation lap which immediately precedes the sprint session and the race and the time when the last car enters the parc fermé, no one is allowed on the track, the pit entry road or the pit exit road with the exception of:

### a)

Marshals or other authorised personnel in the execution of their duty.

### b)

Drivers when driving or on foot, having first received permission to do so from a marshal.

### c)

Team personnel when either pushing a car or clearing equipment from the grid after all cars able to do so have left the grid on the formation lap.

### d)

Team personnel when assisting marshals to remove a car from the grid after the start of the sprint session or the race.

## 26.8

During a sprint session and a race, the engine may only be started with the starter except in the pit lane or the Competitors’ designated garage area where the use of an external starting device is allowed.

## 26.9

Drivers taking part in any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session or the race must always wear flame-resistant clothing, helmets, and Frontal Head Restraints (FHR) specified in the Code.

## 26.10

Any driver whose car has significant and obvious damage to a structural component which results in it being in a condition presenting an immediate risk of endangering the driver or others, or whose car has a significant failure or fault which means it cannot reasonably return to the pit lane without unnecessarily impeding another competitor or otherwise hindering the Competition must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so.
At the sole discretion of the Race Director, should a car be deemed to have such significant and obvious damage to a structural component, or such significant failure or fault, the Competitor may be instructed that the car must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so.

## 26.11

The lights described in Article 14.3 of the Technical Regulations must be illuminated at all times when using intermediate or wet-weather tyres. All lights must be in working order when the car leaves the pit lane for the first time for any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session, or race. It shall be at the discretion of the Race Director to decide whether or not a driver should be stopped if the central rear light described in Article 14.3.2 of the Technical Regulations and at least one of the side lights described in Article 14.3.3 of the Technical Regulations are not working. Should a car be stopped in this way the driver may re-join when the fault has been remedied.

## 26.12

Only twelve (12) team members for each Competitor are permitted in the signalling area during any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session and the race.

## 26.13

Unless authorised by the FIA no one under the age of 16 is permitted in the pit lane at the following times:

The period commencing fifteen (15) minutes prior to and ending five (5) minutes after every free practice session, the qualifying session, and the sprint qualifying session.

### b)

The period commencing fifteen (15) minutes before the pit exit is opened to allow cars to cover reconnaissance laps and the time when the last car enters the parc fermé after the sprint session or the race has ended.

## 26.14

The Race Director, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or the Medical Delegate can require a driver to have a medical examination at any time during a Competition.
If, after an incident, the Impact Warning Light is activated the driver may, at the discretion of the Race Director, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or the Medical Delegate, be required to be examined by the Competition medical service without delay. The Medical Delegate will determine the most appropriate time and place for this examination.

## 26.15

The organiser must make at least two (2) fire extinguishers of 5kg capacity available to each Competitor and ensure that they work properly.

## 26.16

Animals, except those which may have been expressly authorised by the FIA for use by security services, are forbidden on the track, in the pit lane, in the paddock or in any spectator area.

## 26.17

Other than where permitted in Articles 57 and 58, tyre blankets are not permitted in the Pit Lane at any time during the sprint session or the race and must be removed before the tyres are carried to the pit stop area.

## 26.18

Except during a sprint session suspension or race suspension, any car abandoned on the circuit by its driver, even temporarily, shall be considered as withdrawn from the session. In exceptional circumstances, cars abandoned on the circuit during a sprint session suspension or race suspension may be allowed to participate when that session resumes, provided they were not abandoned because of a mechanical issue, car damage or in order to gain an advantage.

## 26.19

If the Official Weather Service predicts that the Heat Index will be greater than 31.0°C at some time during the sprint session or the race at a Competition, or at the sole discretion of the Race Director, a Heat Hazard may be declared twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled start of the Competition. Once a Heat Hazard is declared it shall remain in force for the Competition. All competitors will be notified via the official messaging system. Once a Heat Hazard is declared:

### a)

All components of the Driver Cooling Systems, with the exception of any cooling medium and any items of a driver’s personal equipment that form part of the system, must be fitted.

### b)

At the start of any sprint session or race for which a Heat Hazard has been declared, all components of the Driver Cooling System must be fitted. The system must be functional and available for use by the driver, meeting the specific provisions provided in Article 14.6.1 of the Technical Regulations for these sessions.
However, any driver may elect not to wear any items of personal equipment that form part of the driver cooling system. In such circumstance, all other components, including any cooling medium, of the Driver Cooling System must be fitted. In addition, the difference in mass between the driver’s personal equipment normally used and any items of a driver’s personal equipment that form part of the system must be compensated by the fitting of 0.5kg of ballast in the cockpit, such ballast designated for this purpose will be included in sum of masses described in Article 4.7b of the Technical Regulations.

### c)
