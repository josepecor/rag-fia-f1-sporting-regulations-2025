# Article 28 – Power unit usage

## 28.1 The only power unit that may be used at a Competition during the 2022-2025 Championship seasons is a power unit which is constituted only of elements that were in conformity, at the date they were introduced in the race pool, with the latest submitted and approved homologation dossier as defined in Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations.
## 28.2 Unless a driver drives for more than one (1) Competitor (see Article 28.4 below), and subject to the additions described below, each driver may use no more than four (4) engines (ICE), four (4) motor generator units-heat (MGU-H), four (4) turbochargers (TC), two (2) energy stores (ES), two (2) control electronics (CE), four (4) motor generator units-kinetic (MGU-K) and eight (8) of each of the four (4) elements constituting a set of Engine exhaust systems during a Championship. For the purpose of this article a set of Engine exhaust systems is deemed to comprise the following four (4) elements: primaries LHS, primaries RHS, secondary LHS and secondary RHS.
## 28.3 Should a driver use more Power Unit elements than the numbers prescribed in Article 28.2 of any one of the elements during a Championship, a grid place penalty for the race will be imposed upon him at the first Competition during which each additional element is used. Penalties will be applied according to the following table and will be cumulative:
a) The first time an additional element of each type is used: Ten (10) grid place penalty for the race.
b)The next times an additional element of each type is used: Five (5) grid place penalty for the race.
Any of the seven (7) elements will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.
During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same Power Unit element which is subject to penalties, only the last element fitted may be used at subsequent Competitions without further penalty.
## 28.4 If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship his replacement will be deemed to be the original driver for the purposes of assessing Power Unit usage.
## 28.5 After consultation with the relevant Power Unit Manufacturer the FIA will attach seals to each of the relevant elements of the Power Unit prior to them being used for the first time at a Competition in order to ensure that no significant parts can be rebuilt or replaced. Exhaust elements defined in Article 28.2 above should be permanently and uniquely marked, which is then clearly visible directly or using an optical device in a timely manner when a Power Unit is fitted to a chassis.
Within two (2) hours of the end of the post-race Parc Fermé additional seals will be applied to all used power unit elements in order to ensure that they cannot be run or dismantled between Competitions. The sealing method must be agreed with the Technical Delegate.
Upon request to the FIA, these additional seals will be removed twenty-four (24) hours before the scheduled start of P1 at the next Competition at which the Power Unit elements are required. All such Power Unit elements must remain within the Competitor’s designated garage area when not fitted to a car and may not be started at any time during a Competition other than when fitted to a car eligible to participate in the Competition.
If any of the FIA seals are damaged or removed from the relevant components within the Power Unit after they have been used for the first time those parts may not be used again unless they were removed under FIA supervision.
