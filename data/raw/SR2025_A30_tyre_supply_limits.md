# Article 30 – Supply of tyres and tyre limitations

## 30.1 Supply of tyres

### a)

The single tyre manufacturer (the appointed tyre supplier) appointed by the FIA must undertake to provide:

#### i)

At each Competition, three (3) specifications of dry-weather tyre, one (1) specification of intermediate tyre, and one (1) specification of wet-weather tyre. Each of which must be visibly distinguishable from one another when a car is on the track.

#### iii)

At a maximum of two Competitions where a sprint session is not scheduled, additional specifications of dry-weather tyres may be made available to all Competitors for evaluation purposes. Should either of these Competitions be found to be unsuitable for an effective evaluation of these tyres (due to issues such as weather), additional dry-weather tyres may be made available at a third Competition.

Any driver who uses a set of tyres of differing specifications or tyres not allocated to him during the sprint session or the race may not cross the Line on the track more than twice before returning to the pits and changing them for a set of tyres of the same specification. A penalty under Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who does not change tyres as specified above. For the avoidance of doubt, a set of tyres of differing specifications will not be considered when assessing the number of specifications used during the race.

### c)

Tyres fitted in the pit lane will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane with these tyres fitted.

If additional specifications of dry-weather tyres are made available in accordance with Article 30.1a)iii), these tyres will be allocated to each Driver for use during P2. If P2 is unsuitable for the evaluation of these tyres (such as due to poor weather) they will not be made available to each Driver and they may be carried over to the back-up Competition, as advised by the FIA. Unless the additional tyres have not been made available, or the session is declared wet, all Drivers will have to use them during P2, according to run plans specified by the appointed tyre supplier with the same number of laps per Driver, and the only dry weather tyres that may be used are those allocated under Article 30.1a)iii).

Set-up changes and driver control changes must be agreed in advance with the tyre supplier. Component and software changes must be approved by the FIA. A replacement component may be approved in cases such as damage to the original and should be of the same specification. Exceptionally, if a same specification component is unavailable, a component of a different specification which has been previously used at a Competition or TCC may be approved.

#### iii)

Additional sensors and logging
Additional sensors may be fitted on the car to measure tyre state and or performance and must be agreed with the appointed tyre supplier and the FIA in advance. Data collected from such sensors must be shared with the appointed tyre supplier in due time after the test session, and processed data from such sensors (having removed any team-specific information) may be shared by the appointed tyre supplier with the other Competitors.

### b)

Tyres supplied to any Competitor at any time may not be used on any rig or vehicle (other than a Formula One car on an FIA Grade 1 or FIA Grade 1T Circuit, at the exclusion of any kind of road simulator), either Competitor owned or rented, providing measurements of forces and/or moments produced by a rotating full size Formula One tyre, other than forces acting within 10° of Zw as defined in Article 2.11.3 of the Technical Regulations, tyre rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag.

### c)

Tyres may be used on a test rig providing forces control and monitoring by Formula One rim manufacturers for the sole purpose of proof testing their products.
