# Article 35 – Weighing

## 35.1

After any free practice session or during the qualifying session or during the sprint qualifying session cars will be weighed as follows:

### a)

When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his engine.

### b)

Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage, will be referred to the stewards.

### c)

Each driver must be weighed by the Technical Delegate at the end of the last part of the qualifying session or sprint qualifying session in which they participated.

### d)

At the end of the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session all cars which took part in Q3 (or SQ3) will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.

### e)

If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to the pit lane in order for his weight to be established.

## 35.2

After the sprint session or the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.

## 35.3

The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1 of the Technical Regulations when weighed in accordance with Articles 35.1 or 35.2, save where the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car.

## 35.4

No substance may be added to, placed on, or removed from a car after it has been selected for weighing or has finished the sprint session or the race or during the weighing procedure. (Except by a scrutineer when acting in his official capacity).

## 35.5

In the event of any breach of these provisions for the weighing of cars the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate or disqualify him from the sprint session or the race.
