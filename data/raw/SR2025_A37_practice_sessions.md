# Article 37 – Practice sessions

## 37.1

No driver may start a sprint session or the race without taking part in at least one (1) practice session.

## 37.2

During all practice sessions there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars may only leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light will be shown in the pit exit road to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are approaching on the track.

## 37.3

Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be used for purposes other than the Competition after the last practice session on each day of practice, after the sprint session (where it is scheduled), and on the day of the race no less than one (1) hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to allow cars to cover a reconnaissance lap.

## 37.4

In the event of a driving infringement during any free practice session, qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session the Stewards may delete a driver’s lap time (or lap times) or drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate.

### a)

Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any such incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session.

### b)

Any such grid position penalties will be served in the race, unless the driving infringement occurred in the sprint qualifying session, in which case such penalty will be applied to the grid of the sprint session.

### c)

Where appropriate, regard will also be given to the provisions of Article 18.1.

## 37.5

Any driver taking part in any free practice session, the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session who, in the opinion of the stewards, stops unnecessarily on the circuit or unnecessarily impedes another driver shall be subject to the penalties referred to in Article 37.4.

## 37.6

Should it become necessary to stop any free practice session, the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session because the circuit is blocked by an accident or because weather or other conditions make it dangerous to continue, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at the Line.

### a)

When the signal is given to stop all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).

### b)

All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place.

### c)

At the end of each free practice session, any period of the qualifying session (Q1, Q2, Q3) or any period of the sprint qualifying session (SQ1, SQ2, SQ3) no driver may cross the Line more than once.

## 37.7

The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session will the session be extended as a result.

### a)

Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the possible effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start the race or the sprint session.
