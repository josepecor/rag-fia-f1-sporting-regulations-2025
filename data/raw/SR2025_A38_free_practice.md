# Article 38 – Free Practice

## 38.1

At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled:

### a)

One (1) free practice session (P1), lasting one (1) hour will take place on the first day of on track running.

## 38.2 At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled:

### a)

Two (2) free practice sessions (P1 and P2), each lasting one (1) hour and separated by no less than two (2) hours and no more than three (3) hours, take place on the first day of on track running.

#### i)

Within three (3) hours of the end of the second free practice session (P2) all cars used during each session (or which were intended for use but failed to leave the pit lane) must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied in order to ensure that they remain secure until the following day. Failure to comply with this requirement will be equivalent to a breach of Article 23.5g)i) and failure to comply with both Articles will be considered as a single breach.

#### ii)

Whilst cars are covered overnight, they may be fitted with devices to keep them warm.

#### iii)

For the purpose of this Article 38.2 only, a car is defined as consisting of all the components required to comply with the Technical Regulations with the exception of the Floor, the nose, the Front Wing and the Rear Wing as detailed in Articles 3.5, 3.6.1, 3.9 and 3.10 of the Technical Regulations respectively. Components must be of a specification already used at the
Competition or intended as an option at the Competition. Obsolete components or dummy components are not permitted. If the car is supported on stands, all car components must be present under the cover. The complete car, minus any exceptions described in this Article and including any non-fitted components must remain in view of the overhead camera at all times. Permitted breather, heating or cooling devices may be fitted.

### b)

A further free practice session (P3), lasting one (1) hour and starting no less than eighteen (18) hours after the end of P2, will take place on the second day of on track running.

#### i)

Three (3) hours before the start of P3, the FIA seals and covers may be removed.

### c)

If additional specifications of tyres are provided for evaluation under Article 30.1a)iii), (or if this has been scheduled and subsequently postponed or cancelled) free practice session P2 will be increased in duration to last one and a half (1.5) hours. In such instances the free practice session P3 will start no less than seventeen and a half (17.5) hours after the end of P2.

## 38.3 After the end of each free practice session, as defined in Articles 38.1 and 38.2, any driver on track when the end-of-session signal is shown may carry out a practice start on the grid. Any such driver wishing to perform a practice start must:

### a)

Cross the Line following the end-of-session signal being shown, complete one (1) further lap and proceed to the grid.

### b)

Perform the start from a marked grid position, pulling as far forward on the grid as possible.

### c)

Under no circumstances perform a practice start if another car remains stationary in front of them on the same side of the grid.
If the Race Director considers it is necessary to stop the conduct of practice starts, a red flag will be displayed, and the abort lights will be shown at the Line. In the event of a red flag any driver remaining on the grid must move away slowly and all cars remaining on track must proceed slowly into the pit lane.
