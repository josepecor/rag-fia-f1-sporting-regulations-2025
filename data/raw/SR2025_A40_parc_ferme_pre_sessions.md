# Article 40 – Pre-sprint and pre-race parc fermé

## 40.1

Each Competitor must provide the Technical Delegate with a suspension set-up sheet for both of their cars before each of them leaves the pit lane for the first time during the sprint qualifying session and the qualifying session.

## 40.2

Each car will be deemed to be in parc fermé from the time at which it leaves the pit lane for the first time during the sprint qualifying session until the start of the sprint, and from the time at which it leaves the pit lane for the first time during the qualifying session until the start of the race. Any car which fails to leave the pit lane during the sprint qualifying session or qualifying session will be deemed to be in parc fermé at the end of SQ1 or Q1 respectively.
Between these times, other than when the cars are sealed overnight in accordance with Article 40.6, the following work may be carried out:

### a) Brakes

#### i) Brake friction material may be removed, measured, de-glazed and refitted.

#### ii) The brake system may be bled.

### b) Bodywork

#### i) The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. No parts may be added, removed or replaced.

#### ii) Bodywork (excluding radiators and heat exchangers) may be removed.

#### iii)The front and rear wing assemblies may be inspected with the use of NDT methods, provided no disassembly takes place.

#### iv)Cosmetic changes may be made to the bodywork and tape may be added.

#### v)Any part of the car may be cleaned.

#### vi)Bodywork fixings (consumable fasteners) may be replaced.

#### vii)Any bodywork component may be repaired where the damage is patched, bonded, or fixed together. Any such repair must cause no more than incidental changes in bodywork geometry, and no replacement components or sub-components may be used.

### c)

Climatic Conditions – If the Technical Delegate is satisfied that changes in climatic conditions necessitate alterations of the specification of a car, all competitors will be notified (via the official messaging system) with the message “CHANGE IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS”. From this point onwards until the start of the subsequent sprint session or race changes may be made to:

#### i)

Components specified in Articles 3.13.3 and 3.13.4 of the Technical Regulations.

#### ii)

Power unit and / or gearbox cooling bodywork that lies within RV-BODY-REAR and / or RV-RBW-EC reference volumes as defined in Appendix 1 of the Technical Regulations.

#### iii)

The settings of any bypass valves or flow restrictors used within the liquid part(s) of the cooling system(s) may also be adjusted, for the sole purpose of adjusting power unit and / or gearbox cooling.

#### iv)

Pitot tubes may be covered or uncovered.

#### v)

The addition or removal of the Driver Cooling Scoop described in Article 3.6.5 of the Technical Regulations.

### d) Driver Comfort

#### i) Changes to improve the driver’s comfort. In this context anything other than the adjustment of the mirrors, seat belts and pedals may only be carried out with the specific permission of the Technical Delegate.

#### ii) Should ambient temperature change significantly, Competitors will be requested (via the official messaging system) to change the head padding required by Article 12.6.1 of the Technical Regulations.

#### iii) The additional or removal of padding (or similar material) is also permitted but may only be carried out under supervision and, if required by the Technical Delegate, must be removed before the post-race weighing procedure.

#### iv) If a Heat Hazard has been declared in accordance with Article 26.19, the cooling medium used in the Driver Cooling System, as defined in Article 14.6 of the Technical Regulations, may be added, replenished or replaced.

### e) Electronics

#### i) On board cameras, marshalling system components, timing transponders and any associated equipment may be removed, refitted or checked.

#### ii) A jump battery may be connected and on-board electrical units may be freely accessed via a physical connection to the car.

#### iii) Charging and / or discharging of the ERS energy storage devices.

#### iv) The repair of an electronic component (e.g. damaged connector pin, wiring loom involving heatshrink, protecting sleeving, enclosure bonding)

### f) Fluids

#### i) Fuel may be drained or added.

#### ii) Compressed gases may be drained or added.

#### iii)Permitted breather, heating or cooling devices may be fitted.

#### iv) Fluids may be drained and/or replenished, however, fluids used for replenishment must conform to the same specification as the original fluids(s).

#### v) Drinking fluid for the driver may be added at any time, however, the capacity of the container for any such fluid must not exceed 1.5 litres.

### g)Repair of genuine accident damage, defined as any of the following:

#### i) Damage sustained as a result of contact with a barrier.

#### ii) Damage sustained as a result of contact with another car on track.

#### iii)Damage incurred whilst off track limits, which also result in significant loss of lap time or a lap time which is deleted by the Race Director.

### h)Powertrain

#### i) Engines may be started.

#### ii) Spark plugs may be removed in order to carry out an internal engine inspection and cylinder compression checks.

### i) Tyres

#### i) Wheels, wheel fasteners and tyres may be removed, changed or rebalanced.

#### ii) Tyre pressures may be adjusted.

### j)

A change of car, as defined in Article 27.2, if that car has suffered genuine accident damage or has suffered a significant failure or fault, as defined in Article 27.1, necessitating a change of survival cell. All components of the replacement car must be the same in design and similar in mass, inertia, and function to the original car. The set-up of the suspension must be the same.

### k) Work required by the Technical Delegate.

## 40.3

Any parts which are removed from the car in order to carry out any work specifically permitted in Article 40.2, or any parts removed to carry out essential safety checks, must remain close to the car and, at all times, be visible to the scrutineer assigned to the relevant car. Furthermore, any parts removed from the car in order to carry out any such work must be refitted before the car leaves the pit lane.

Any work not listed in Article 40.2 may only be undertaken with the approval of the Technical Delegate following a written request from the Competitor concerned. It must be clear that any replacement part a Competitor wishes to fit is the same in design and similar in mass, inertia and function to the original. Any parts which are removed shall be retained by the FIA.
If a Competitor wishes to change a part during the sprint qualifying session, qualifying session, on the grid before the start of the sprint session and between reconnaissance laps and / or on the grid before the start of the race, this may be done without first seeking the permission of the Technical Delegate, provided it is reasonable for the relevant Competitor to believe permission would be given if there was time to ask and the broken or damaged part remains in full view of the scrutineer assigned to the car at all times.

## 40.4

Exceptionally, at each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, requests made under 40.3 for replacement parts that are different in design will be considered for approval where the Competitor can demonstrate there is a shortage of parts, and provided that the replacement part is of a specification that has been previously used in a sprint qualifying session, a sprint session, a qualifying session or a race. In such cases, the Competitor must inform the FIA in writing prior to the start of the sprint session of any parts where this may be necessary.

## 40.5

At the end of each sprint qualifying and qualifying session the FIA will select specific cars to undergo further checks. Once informed their car has been selected the Competitor concerned must take the car to the Parc Fermé immediately.

## 40.6

Within two (2) hours of the end of both the sprint qualifying (where it is scheduled) and the qualifying session all cars used during each session (or which were intended for use but failed to leave the pit lane) must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied. For marketing purposes this deadline may be extended for one car from each Competitor for a maximum of two (2) hours by prior arrangement with the Technical Delegate. Whilst cars are covered overnight, they may be fitted with devices to keep them warm. In the case of a breach of this Article, it will also be considered that the Competitor has breached Article 40.9. The relevant driver will be penalised by a single penalty for the combination of both offences.

## 40.7

At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, three (3) hours before the scheduled start of the formation lap for the sprint, the seals and covers may be removed but the cars will remain under parc fermé conditions until the start of the sprint.

## 40.8

Five (5) hours before the scheduled start of the formation lap for the race, the seals and covers may be removed but the cars will remain under parc fermé conditions until the start of the race.

## 40.9

A Competitor may not modify any part on the car or make changes to the set-up of the suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions. In the case of a breach of this Article:

### a)

At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled, the relevant driver must start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 44.2.

### b)

At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, if the parc fermé conditions are breached before the start of the sprint session, the relevant driver must start the sprint session from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 43.3. If the parc fermé conditions are breached after the start of the qualifying session the relevant driver must start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 44.2.
In order that the scrutineers may be completely satisfied that no alterations have been made to the suspension systems or aerodynamic configuration of the car (with the exception of the front wing) whilst in pre-race parc fermé, it must be clear from physical inspection that changes cannot be made without the use of tools.

## 40.10

One (1) scrutineer will be allocated to each car for the purpose of ensuring that no unauthorised work is carried out whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions.

## 40.11

A list of parts replaced with the specific agreement of the Technical Delegate whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions will be published and distributed to all Competitors prior to the race.

## 40.12

The mass of oil contained in each oil tank, with the exception of the main oil tank, must be declared to the FIA one (1) hour before the scheduled start of the race.
