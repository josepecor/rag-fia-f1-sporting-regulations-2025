# Article 44 – Race starting procedure

## 44.1

Forty (40) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened and all cars, including any that are required to start the race from the pit lane, will be permitted to leave the pit lane to cover a reconnaissance lap. Should any driver wish to cover more than one reconnaissance lap, this must be done by driving down the pit entry road and pit lane at greatly reduced speed between each of the laps. If a driver stops in his pit between reconnaissance laps the car may only re-join the track by being driven from the driver’s garage and not from his pit stop position.
At the end of these laps all cars starting the race from the grid should stop on the grid in starting order with their engines stopped and all cars required to start the race from the pit lane must enter the pit lane.
All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane whether a driver is going to the pit exit from his garage or travelling through the pit lane between reconnaissance laps.
Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power will not be permitted to start the race from the grid.

## 44.2

Thirty-two (32) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be given indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes.
Thirty (30) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be closed and a second warning signal will be given. Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there under its own power. If more than one car is affected, they must line up in the order in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane after the five (5) minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit.

## 44.3

The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten (10) minutes, five (5) minutes, three (3) minutes, one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds before the start of the formation lap, each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning.
When the ten (10) minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical staff must leave the grid.

## 44.4

When the five (5) minute signal is shown all cars on the grid and any cars in the pit lane fast lane must:

### a)

have their wheels fitted; and

### b)

tyre blankets on the wheels fitted must be disconnected from any power supply at this time and must not be reconnected during the start procedure, unless the delayed start or aborted start signal is subsequently shown; and

### c)

team personnel and equipment trolleys must commence leaving the grid.
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the five (5) minute signal.
After this signal wheels may only be removed in the pit lane inner lane.

## 44.5

When the three (3) minute signal is shown, no more than sixteen (16) team personnel for each Competitor are permitted on the grid.

## 44.6

When the one (1) minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must leave the grid, and the pit lane fast lane if working in accordance with Article 34.9, by the time the fifteen (15) second signal is given taking all equipment with them.

### a)

If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car on the grid after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown the driver of the car concerned must start the race from the pit lane as specified in Article 44.2. A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane.
If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car that is in the pit lane fast lane after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown a penalty in accordance with Article 54.3c will be imposed on that driver.

### b)

If any driver needs assistance after the fifteen (15) second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the grid, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the pit lane inner lane.

In either of the above cases, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind.

## 44.7

When the green lights on the start gantry are illuminated, all cars on the grid able to do so should begin the formation lap with the pole position driver leading. When leaving the grid all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position.
Once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane for the formation lap, the pit exit will be opened and all cars starting from the pit lane able to do so must leave the pit lane and join the formation lap. When such cars are permitted to leave the pit lane they must do so in the order that was established under Article 44.2 unless another car is unduly delayed. Once all such cars have left the pit lane the pit exit will be closed. All such cars must enter the pit lane at the end of the formation lap.

## 44.8

During the formation lap practice starts are forbidden and the formation must be kept as tight as possible.

## 44.9

Overtaking during the formation lap is only permitted if a car is delayed and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. In this case, drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order. Any driver delayed in this way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line, must enter the pit lane and start from the end of the pit lane as specified in Article 44.11.
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line.

## 44.10

When the cars starting from the grid return to the grid at the end of the formation lap or laps, they must stop within their respective starting grid positions, keeping their engines running.

### a)

There will be a standing start, the signal being given by means of lights activated by the permanent starter.

### b)

Once all the cars have come to a halt the five (5) second light will appear followed by the four, three, two and one second lights. At any time after the one-second light appears, the race will be started by extinguishing all red lights.

## 44.11

When the cars required to start from the pit lane return to the pit lane at the end of the formation lap or laps, they must proceed to pit exit and stop in a line in the fast lane in the order in which they arrive, keeping their engines running. Once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane for the first time after the start, the pit exit will be opened and all cars starting from the pit lane may then join the race.

## 44.12

If a car is immobilised on the starting grid at any time after the formation lap has commenced and prior to the race start:

### a)

The driver must immediately raise their hands above their head to signal they have a problem;

### b)

The marshals alongside the grid, responsible for that row, must immediately wave a yellow flag and/or activate the yellow grid light panel to signal that a car is immobilised on the grid.

### c)

When the Race Director deems it is safe to do so, it shall be the duty of the marshals to push any immobilised car into the pit lane inner lane by the fastest route. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car; and

### d)

Once the car is in the pit lane inner lane team personnel may attempt to start it, if successful the driver may enter the fast lane once the pit exit is opened in accordance with Article 44.11 and re-join the race. The driver and mechanics must follow the instructions of the marshals at all times during such a procedure.
