# Article 54 – Incidents during the sprint session or the race

## 54.1

The Race Director may report any on-track incident or suspected breach of these Sporting Regulations or the Code (an “Incident”) to the stewards. After review it shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide whether or not to proceed with an investigation.
The stewards may also investigate an Incident noted by themselves.

## 54.2

### a)

It shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide if any driver involved in an Incident should be penalised.

Unless it is clear to the stewards that a driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for an Incident no penalty will be imposed.

### b)

If an Incident is under investigation by the stewards a message informing all Competitors which driver or drivers are involved will be sent using the official messaging system.

#### i)

Provided that such a message is displayed no later than sixty (60) minutes after the sprint session or the race has finished the driver or drivers concerned may not leave the circuit without the consent of the stewards.

## 54.3

The stewards may impose any one of the penalties below on any driver involved in an Incident:

### a)

A five (5) second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least five seconds and then re-join the sprint session or the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the sprint session or the race. In such cases five (5) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of the sprint session or race time of the driver concerned.

### b)

A ten (10) second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the sprint session or the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the sprint session or the race. In such cases ten (10) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of the sprint session or race time of the driver concerned.

In both of the above cases the driver concerned must carry out the penalty the next time he enters the pit lane and, for the avoidance of doubt, this includes any stop the driver makes whilst a VSC or safety car procedure is in use.

### c)

A drive-through penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane and re-join the sprint session or the race without stopping.

### d)

A ten second stop-and-go time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the sprint session or the race.

If any of the four (4) penalties above are imposed upon a driver, and that driver is unable to serve the penalty due to being unclassified in the sprint session or the race in the case of a) or b) or due to retirement from the sprint session or the race in the case of c) or d), the stewards may impose a grid place penalty on the driver at their next race.

If any of the four (4) penalties above are imposed during the last three (3) laps, or after the end of a sprint session or a race, Article 54.4b) will not apply and five seconds will be added to the elapsed time of the driver concerned in the case of (a) above, 10 seconds in the case of (b), 20 seconds in the case of (c) and 30 seconds in the case of (d).

### e) A time penalty.

### f) A reprimand.

### g) A drop of any number of grid positions at the driver’s next race.

If any of the seven penalties above are imposed they shall not be subject to appeal.

### h) Disqualification from the results.

### i) Suspension from the driver’s next Competition.

## 54.4

Should the stewards decide to impose any of the penalties under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d), the following procedure will be followed:

### a)

The stewards will give written notification of the penalty which has been imposed to the Competitor concerned and will inform all Competitors using the official messaging system.

### b)

With the exception of Articles 54.3a) and 54.3b) above, from the time the Competitor concerned is notified of the stewards’ decision using the official messaging system the relevant driver may cross the Line on the track no more than twice before entering the pit lane and, in the case of a penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d), proceeding to his pit stop position where he shall remain for the period of the time penalty.
However, unless the driver was already in the pit entry road for the purpose of serving his penalty, he may not carry out the penalty if the VSC procedure is in use or after the safety car has been deployed. The number of times the driver crosses the Line behind the safety car or during the VSC procedure will be added to the maximum number of times he may cross the Line on the track.

### c)

Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a penalty in accordance with Articles 54.3a) or 54.3b) above, it may not be worked on until the car has been stationary for the duration of the penalty. In this context, touching the car or driver by hand or tools or equipment will all constitute working.

### d)

Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a time penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) above it may not be worked on. However, if the engine stops any work necessary to re-start it may be carried out after the time penalty period has elapsed. If the Competitor is unable to start the engine the car may then only be worked on in the driver’s garage.

### e)

Any breach or failure to comply with Articles 54.4b), 54.4c) or 54.4d) may result in a further penalty, such penalty will supersede and replace the penalty which was subject to the breach or failure to comply.
