# Article 56 – Virtual safety car

## 56.1

The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a practice session, sprint session or a race upon the order of the clerk of the course.

### a)

It will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and Competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself.

## 56.2

When the order is given to initiate the VSC procedure a message “VSC DEPLOYED” will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system and all FIA light panels will display “VSC”.

## 56.3

No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the VSC procedure is in use. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry road, or the pit lane.

## 56.4

When initiated during a sprint session or a race, no car may enter the pits whilst the VSC procedure is in use unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres.

## 56.5

All competing cars must reduce speed and stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All cars must also be above this minimum time when the FIA light panels change to green (see Article 56.7 below).
When initiated during the sprint session or a race, the stewards may impose any of the penalties under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above.

## 56.6

With the exception of the cases listed under a) to d) below, no driver may overtake another car on the track whilst the VSC procedure is in use.
The exceptions are:

### a)

When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track after he has reached the first safety car line.

### b)

When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track before he reaches the second safety car line.

### c)

Whilst in the pit entry road, pit lane or pit exit road a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas.

### d)

If any car slows with an obvious problem.

## 56.7

When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to end the VSC procedure the message “VSC ENDING” will be sent to all Competitors via the official messaging system and, at any time between 10 and 15 seconds later, “VSC” on the FIA light panels will change to green and drivers may continue the session or continue racing immediately. After 30 seconds the green lights will be extinguished.

## 56.8

Each lap completed whist the VSC procedure is in use during a sprint session or the race will be counted as a lap.
