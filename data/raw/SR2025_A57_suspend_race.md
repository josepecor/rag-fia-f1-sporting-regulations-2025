# Article 57 – Suspending a sprint session or a race

## 57.1

If Competitors or officials are placed in immediate physical danger by cars running on the track, and the clerk of the course deems circumstances are such that the track cannot be negotiated safely, even behind the safety car, the sprint session or the race will be suspended.

## 57.2

The first car to arrive in the pit lane should proceed directly to the pit exit staying in the fast lane, all the other cars should form up in a line behind the first car.

In exceptional circumstances, for reasons of safety the pit entry may be closed before cars have returned to the pit lane. In such circumstances all cars must proceed slowly to the starting grid, the first car to arrive on the grid should occupy pole position and others should fill the remaining grid positions in the order they arrive. The remainder of the procedures detailed in Articles 57.3, 57.4, 57.5 and 58 shall remain unchanged, but will be conducted on the grid instead of in the fast lane.

Any cars in the pit lane or pit entry road at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended will be arranged in the order they occupied before the sprint session or the race was suspended. Any cars in their garage at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended will be arranged at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order they got there.

In all cases the order will be taken at the last point at which it was possible to determine the position of all cars. All such cars will then be permitted to resume the sprint session or the race.
