# Article 59 – Finish

## 59.1

A chequered flag will be the end-of-session signal and will be shown at the Line as soon as the leading car has covered the full distance in accordance with Article 5.3.

## 59.2

Should for any reason the end-of-session signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the sprint session or the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the Line before the signal was given.

Should the end-of-session signal be delayed for any reason, the sprint session or the race will be deemed to have finished when it should have finished.

## 59.3

After receiving the end-of-session signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary).

An exception to Article 26.4 and to the above will be made for the winning driver of the race who may perform an act of celebration before reaching parc fermé, provided any such act:

### a)

Is performed safely and does not endanger other drivers or any officials.

### b)

Does not call into question the legality of his car.

### c)

Does not delay the podium ceremony.

Any classified car which cannot reach the parc fermé under its own power will be placed under the exclusive control of the marshals who will take the car to the parc fermé.
