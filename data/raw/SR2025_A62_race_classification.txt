# Article 62 – Race classification

62.1 The car placed first will be the one having covered the scheduled distance in the shortest time, or, where appropriate, passed the Line in the lead at the end of two (2) hours (or more under Article 5.4). All cars will be classified taking into account the number of complete laps they have covered, and for those which have completed the same number of laps, the order in which they crossed the Line.

62.2 Cars having covered less than 90% of the number of laps covered by the winner (rounded down to the nearest whole number of laps), will not be classified.

62.3 The provisional classification will be published after the race. It will be the only valid result subject to any amendments which may be made under the Code and these Sporting Regulations.
